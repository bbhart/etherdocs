# Private ethereum chain


From https://souptacular.gitbooks.io/ethereum-tutorials-and-tips-by-hudson/content/private-chain.html, https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Private-network, the Ethereum docs, and other sources.

By the end of this doc you'll have your own Ethereum blockchain, completely separate from the rest of
the world. This is not to be confused with one of the public "testnets", though it's a similar idea.
Mining is easy here -- you'll generate coins easily -- but you won't have anywhere to spend them.
But if you want to test things out (like writing contracts you might not want people to see yet),
this is where you want to do it.

A private chain consists of:
* Configuration file creating the first ("genesis") block
* Private directory for data
* Custom networkID
* A running node with access to the data

# Creating a private chain
By the end of this section, you'll have a private Ethereum blockchain on your machine, with a running node, an account to hold your private Ether, and some mined Ether in that account.

Note this assumes you have `geth` already installed and in the path. If you don't, visit the [Ethereum CLI page](https://www.ethereum.org/cli) .

### 1 - Create a directory.
```
mkdir -p ~/chains/private37
cd ~/chains/private37
```

In this case the "37" is an arbitrary integer that I'll match the chainID to.

### 2 - Create a genesis block config file
Change to the new directory and create a file called **genesis.json** with the config for the first block, called the [genesis block](http://ethdocs.org/en/latest/network/test-networks.html#the-genesis-file).

genesis.json: (example)
```json
{
    "config": {
        "chainId": 37,
        "homesteadBlock": 0,
        "eip155Block": 0,
        "eip158Block": 0
    },
    "difficulty": "200000000",
    "gasLimit": "2100000",
    "alloc": { }
}
```


### 3 - Initialize the genesis block
`geth --datadir ~/chains/private37 init genesis.json`

### 4 - Create an account on the chain

Run `geth --datadir ~/chains/private37 account new` to create a new account. Set a password you won't forget.

### 5 - Using the new chain

Choose an arbitrary integer for your networkID or keep what is shown here.
For now, until we can secure things some, disallow connections from peers (`--maxpeers 0`)  and prevent peer discovery (`--nodiscover`).

`geth --datadir ~/chains/private37  --rpc --networkid 37 --nodiscover --maxpeers 0 console`

### 6 - Start mining
Mine some coin into your primary account.
From geth's console:

`> mining.start(4)`

It will create the [DAG](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethash-DAG) (a dataset needed for Ethereum's style of proof-of-work mining), then begin mining.

Let it mine for a few minutes after DAG creation (until you see messages on the cnsole about 'mined potential block'), then check your balance.

### 7 - Check your balance

Check your balance:

`> web3.fromWei(eth.getBalance(eth.coinbase), "ether")`

Success! We now have 5 Ether to play around with in our private chain.
