Two more transfers prior to initial coin sale, one for 12,000,000 tokens and the other 113,650,000, both to the 3D2B account.  Total pre-sale transfers are 133,650,000.

The opening block (3798640) was mined at May-31-2017 02:24:35 PM +UTC (7:24:35 AM Pacific). The miner received 33 ETH (~USD7590) for mining it, which is ~28 ETH more than a normal block (!!).

From there it snowballed. The whole thing was basically over in a few blocks, and the people who made it into those blocks paid a high premium to be in them.

You can pontificate for years on whether how Brave conducted the sale was "fair" or "democratic", but from their point of view everything was A+++++. Think about it: they raised tens of millions of dollars in a matter of seconds, without having to prostrate themselves in front of endless VCs who may or may not "get" what they're trying to do. It's done. They have their money and can execute on their vision.

And I say that as somebody who obsessed about the sale for a few weeks beforehand. I executed buys on the testnet to make sure I knew how to do it. I ensured Mist was synced with the global blockchain and ready to go. I had a special wallet set up, with ETH moved over from GDAX special for the sale. And when I noticed that block 3798640 had already come, 35 minutes earlier than predicted, I jumped in and tried to buy. But it was all for naught. Smarter, richer bots beat me to the punch.
